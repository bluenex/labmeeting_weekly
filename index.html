					<h2>Discussion</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The participants</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Typically in the chronic phase (> 6 months) post-stroke</li>
						<li>One study for acute (4-22 days post) and two for sub-acute (< 3 months)</li>
						<li>Cognitive and perceptual characteristics of the participants <br>were mentioned in all studies</li>
						<blockquote style="font-size:65%; text-align:center">Future characterization of the cognitive, sensory and perceptual abilities of the subjects participating in trials will increase both the external validity and targeted application of VR. It will also <span class="uw">reduce the artificial separation between cognitive and motor rehabilitation.</span></blockquote>
						<li>Most participants had moderately severe motor control impairments <br>(UEFMA 30-42 out of 44)</li>
						<li>One study sample into moderately and mildly impaired groups, with <yellow>more impaired subjects making larger magnitude gains</yellow> with both VR and control interventions </li>
					</ul>
					
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The hardware</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Robotic or motion sensing systems</li>
						<li>Five of UL studies used a motion-sensing interface</li>
						<li>Neither interface appeared to yield superior motor outcomes</li>
						<li>Four UL systems were enhanced with haptics, three were purely visually based, and one had a mixed reality where subjects interacted with real world objects</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote>
						The current literature <span class="uw">does not point to robust clinically meaningful activity level outcomes for haptics added to VR systems</span>.
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>The simulations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Were evenly grouped into two categories: replication of <yellow>real world tasks</yellow> such as reaching and walking, or <yellow>game-based tasks</yellow>, such as flying a plane</li>
						<li>Reaching simulations consistently improved reaching abilities, while game-based UL interventions produced less specific outcomes</li>
						<li>Task-specific training yielded superior results in the UL studies, but not in the gait studies</li>
						<li>Most UL systems (6 of 8) were in 3D</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote style="font-size:75%">However, while the fidelity of movement is enhanced with 3D immersive systems, they are <span class="uw">not superior to 2D non-immersive systems in promoting real world activity level motor outcomes</span>.</blockquote>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>The frequency, duration and distribution</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Training was typically distributed over a week</li>
						<li>The average duration was approximately 4 weeks (UL and gait), but was <yellow>12 weeks</yellow> for some UL studies</li>
						<li>Total training time for the UL studies was an average of <yellow>10.5 h</yellow></li>
						<li>UL studies supported a dose–response relationship between increased training dose and larger improvements in motor function</li>
						<blockquote style="font-size:65%; text-align:center">
							Some of the strongest evidence related to the effectiveness of non-technology-based rehabilitation interventions suggests that <span class="uw">outcomes are related to the dose of the intervention</span>
						</blockquote>
						<li>It is not clear if training doses in VR will compare to real world training doses</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>The progression</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Was achieved with software algorithms and clinician-tester input</li>
						<li>Five of eight UL studies used algorithm for progression</li>
						<li>For UL studies which lacked of an algorithm, the progression was not well described</li>
						<li>The most sophisticated algorithm used <yellow>movement parameters</yellow> such as smoothness of sub-movements to shape the motor behavior and progress the therapy</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote style="font-size:75%">
						It appears that <span class="uw">robotic interfaces have the advantage of using sophisticated algorithms</span> for treatment customization and progression. Whether this benefit merits <span class="uw">the cost is still not clear</span>.
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>The outcomes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Several of the UL studies demonstrated <yellow>statistically significant improvements at the body function level and/or activity level</yellow> for both VR groups and dose-matched controls.</li>
						<li>It is also interesting to note that the <yellow>largest magnitude improvements were reported in the acute stage of recovery</yellow></li>
						<li>Beyond this clear observation, patterns for <yellow>dose–response or acuity levels impacting outcomes were not apparent</yellow></li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Remaining questions</h3>
					<blockquote>
						While the quantity of RCT’s examining VR for stroke rehabilitation is growing, <b><span class="ub">there remain unresolved questions about the technology, clinical characteristics, and practical concerns</span></b> that will affect translation of VR rehabilitation into practice.
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<h5>Technology related</h5>
						<li>Is it necessary to utilize haptic interfaces?</li>
						<li>Are semi-immersive 2D systems <red>as efficacious as immersive systems in reducing impairments</red> and promoting activity?</li>
						<br>
						<li>Do software-controlled algorithms <red>provide greater speed and fidelity</red> of exercise progression?</li>
						<li>Are they superior to expert clinical decision-making?</li>
						<li>Can they be combined with clinician-decision making?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<ul>
						<h5>Participant selection and specificity of training</h5>
						<li>What are the <red>minimal cognitive and perceptual requirements</red> to use virtual environments for sensorimotor rehabilitation effectively?</li>
						<li>How will <red>differences in motor severity, chronicity, and type of task</red> interact with VR system capabilities and dose requirements?</li>
						<br>
						<h5>Practical considerations</h5>
						<li>Will the cost of the sophisticated technology (such a robots interfaced with the VE’s) <red>justify the benefits?</red></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Suggestions</h3>
					<ul>
						<b><p>Should be addressed in future study</p></b>
						<li>The efficacy of VR interventions <red>relative to</red> the current standard of care</li>
						<li>Comparing the <red>efficacy and effectiveness of various approaches</red> to presenting and delivering virtual interventions</li>
