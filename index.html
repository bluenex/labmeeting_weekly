				<section>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul class="blk-75">
						<li>In the past two years, stroke-related medical costs have <red>increased 20%</red> (in US) while <red>the numbers of clinical treatment sessions have declined.</red></li>
						<li>There is a need to create a home-based stroke rehabilitation system that is affordable but remains effective and interesting.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Approaches to Stroke Rehabilitation</h3>
					<ul class="blk-75">
						<li>Traditional customary care involves <red>time intensive treatment from an occupational therapist.</red></li>
						<ul class="ulul">
							<li>performing repetitive movements <b>></b> induce motor learning <b>></b> improve the movement behaviour of the stroke survivor</li>							
						</ul>
						<li>Several alternative rehabilitation methods have been proposed:</li>
						<ul class="ulul">
							<li>Constrained Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li style="font-size:70%"><red>CIMT is only useful for a sub-group of the stroke population because of the mental and psychological requirements in having self-discipline to stick with the program</red></li>
							</ul>
							<li>Robot Assisted Rehabilitation</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li style="font-size:70%"><red>not cost effective for small business nor is it feasible for the home environment</red></li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Studies have shown that the Wii can have a beneficial health impact on stroke survivors.</li>
						<ul class="ulul">
							<li><red>require precise dexterous movements</red></li>
							<li><red>completing game activities under extreme time pressure</red></li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Benefits of gaming</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Playing video games produces gains in certain physical and cognitive abilities.</li>
						<li>Previous studies using video games as the <red>primary intervention</red> have found improvements in:</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li><red>reaction time, short-term and long-term memory, attention,</red> and <red>spatial ability</red></li>
							</ul>
						<li>Different approaches in game design for rehabilitation:</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li>focused on memory and prose recall</li>
								<li>encode specific rehabilitative movements as part of an interactive gaming experience</li>
							</ul>		
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Purpose</h3>
					<blockquote>To create a compelling and fun game/experience that users would <red>enjoy playing</red> and that would <red>also improve the mobility and dexterity</red> of their stroke-affected arm</blockquote>
					<p><b>Rehabilitation Medicine + Computer Science + Engineering</b></p>

					<h2>System Hardware Architecture</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Input Devices</h3>
					<ul class="blk-75">
						<li>Stroke survivors are often not able to grasp and manipulate objects with their affected hand.</li>
						<li>Therefore careful consideration for the input device is needed</li>
						<li><b><yellow>Wii Remote with IR beacons</yellow></b> are used for 2D tracking</li>
						<ul class="ulul">
							<li>The raw 2D forearm tracking data is filtered using a <b><yellow>spring-damper function</yellow></b></li>
							<li>After filtering the data were used for <b><yellow>simple inverse-kinematic (IK)</yellow></b> model of a human arm</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>System Display</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The development and testing of the system was done on a personal computer.</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote>A future design goal for the game display would be to <yellow><b>incorporate a low cost portable console that could connect directly to a television.</b></yellow></blockquote>

					<h2>System Software Architecture</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul class="blk-75">
						<li>The system was developed in the <yellow><b>Unity 3D game engine.</b></yellow></li>
						<li>Unity provides a rapid game prototyping and development environment and based on the Mono .NET software framework</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>System Operation and Content</h3>
					<ul class="blk-75">
						<li>A number of video game styles and genres were considered as prototypes, but the popular casual game Peggle was chosen.</li>
						<li>Peggle itself is loosely based on older, mechanical games such as pinball.</li>
						<li>The player’s score accumulates as pegs are hit and destroyed.</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote>This greatly <b><yellow>simplified and sped up the graphical and game play design phases</yellow></b> and allowed more time and resources to be spent on augmenting and adapting the game to support stroke rehabilitation in the form of encouraging specific arm motions and exercises.
</blockquote>

					<h2>System Design and Usability</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<blockquote>Knowledge gathering exercises were conducted with <yellow>two experts in the field of stroke rehabilitation</yellow> to ensure that the type of arm motions and exercises to be encoded into the game could lead to improvements in stroke survivors</blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>In designing the game, a number of design criteria were developed which would facilitate stroke rehabilitation movements and exercises yet still be fun and compelling.</li>
						<li>The game rules and mechanics should be simple and easily understood with the right balance of skill, chance and strategy.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Design Criteria</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The game design required additional considerations due to the <yellow>uniqueness and limitations of the target users</yellow>  and to the functional requirements for successful physical rehabilitation.</li>
						<li>In particular, to achieve true physical gains the players would need to spend significant time in the environment.</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li>A game that is boring and tedious or an interface that is too physically strenuous would be unacceptable.</li>
								<li>A game mechanic that is too easily mastered or that is too difficult can cause player frustration and nullify benefits of the system.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Designing an environment that leads to a feeling of engagement, immersion and “oneness” with the system is <yellow>more of an art than a science.</yellow></li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li>However, extensive research exists in the area of computer interfaces including the new area of “serious” game design.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Due to limited budget and timeline a case study was conducted where a recent stroke survivor volunteered to evaluate the system.</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li>The stroke survivor had persistent hemiparesis that lead to <yellow><b>impaired upper extremity function</b></yellow> but had <yellow><b>no severe weakness or sensory impairment of the upper extremity.</b></yellow></li>
							</ul>
						<li>Further, the individual stated that the prototype Peggle-based game was <b><yellow>fun and conducive to extended use</yellow></b>, a primary goal of this research.</li>

					<h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>This paper has described the <b>features, design, implementation and operation of the stroke rehabilitative gaming system and preliminary findings</b> from a case-study.</li>
						<li>The system currently supports arm-tracking game control in 2D using only the Wii Remote’s IR camera tracking ability</li>
							<ul class="ulul">
								<li>Future development will include also utilizing the <b>Wii Remote’s three-axis accelerometers and the three-axis gyroscopes of the MotionPlus extension device.</b></li>
								<li>Full, 6 DOF tracking of the player’s arm will <b>allow a much larger range of trackable arm motions</b> as well as <b>many more exercises and motions to be encouraged by stroke rehab game play.</b></li>
							</ul>
